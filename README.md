### Heyo

I'm currently working at [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com) on open source software for scientific imaging.

I have a Ph.D. in medical physics (mostly imaging, mostly MRI) from the University of Wisconsin, but consider myself primarily a programmer.

Most of my programming experience is Python.
I love Rust, but dont have that much real experience with it.
Lately I've been learning (and surprisingly enjoying) TypeScript.
With TypeScript I've been using three.js and WebGL (maybe soon WebGPU).
