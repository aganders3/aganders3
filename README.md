### Heyo

I'm currently working at [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com) on open source software for scientific imaging.

I have a Ph.D. in medical physics (mostly imaging, mostly MRI) from the University of Wisconsin, but consider myself primarily a programmer.

I mostly do 🐍 Python stuff, but I'm spending a lot of my spare time learning 🦀 Rust.
